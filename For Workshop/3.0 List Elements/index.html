Simple & Classic Vanilla Cake Recipe

Ingredients

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1/2 cup whole milk


Instructions

Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Set this dry ingredient mixture aside.
In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. This can be done with a hand mixer or a stand mixer.
Beat in the eggs, one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next. Mix in the vanilla extract.
Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients, and mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as it can make the cake tough.
Divide the cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans.
Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.
Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, remove the cakes from the pans and place them on a wire rack to cool completely.
Once the cakes have cooled, you can frost and decorate them as desired. You can use your favorite frosting, such as buttercream, cream cheese frosting, or any other frosting you prefer.
Slice and enjoy your homemade vanilla cake!
