William Blake (28 November 1757 â€“ 12 August 1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised
during his life, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual art of the Romantic
Age. What he called his "prophetic works" were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form "what is in proportion
to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language".[2] His visual artistry led 21st-century critic
Jonathan Jones to proclaim him "far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced".[3] In 2002, Blake was
placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.[4] While he lived in London his entire life, except
for three years spent in Felpham,[5] he produced a diverse and symbolically rich collection of works, which embraced the
imagination as "the body of God"[6] or "human existence itself".
